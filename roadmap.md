* [ ] Practice using `vipw` and `vigr` to safely edit these files

---

### ðŸ”¸ 4. File Permissions and Ownership

* [ ] Understand read (r), write (w), execute (x) permissions
* [ ] Use `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` to manage permissions
* [ ] Distinguish between user, group, and others
* [ ] Set default permissions using `umask`
* [ ] Apply and explain special permissions: SUID, SGID, Sticky Bit

---

### ðŸ”¸ 5. Managing User Environments

* [ ] Configure default shells for users
* [ ] Understand and customize `.bashrc`, `.profile`, `.bash_profile`
* [ ] Use `/etc/profile` and `/etc/bash.bashrc` for system-wide settings

---

### ðŸ”¸ 6. Session & User Management Tools

* [ ] Monitor logged-in users (`who`, `w`, `users`)
* [ ] Track login history with `last`, `lastlog`
* [ ] Terminate user sessions with `kill`, `pkill`
* [ ] Set user session limits in `/etc/security/limits.conf`

---

### ðŸ”¸ 7. Sudo and Privilege Management

* [ ] Install and configure `sudo`
* [ ] Edit `/etc/sudoers` safely with `visudo`
* [ ] Grant limited root privileges to users and groups
* [ ] Use `sudo` logs for auditing

---

### ðŸ”¸ 8. Password Policies & Account Security

* [ ] Enforce password aging with `chage`
* [ ] Set password complexity via PAM
* [ ] Lock and unlock accounts (`passwd -l`, `passwd -u`)
* [ ] Disable accounts after inactivity
* [ ] Audit users with weak or empty passwords

---

### ðŸ”¸ 9. Bulk User/Group Operations (Intermediate)

* [ ] Create users in batch with scripts or `newusers`
* [ ] Use `cut`, `awk`, and `getent` to extract account info
* [ ] Automate password assignment (e.g., `chpasswd`)

---

### ðŸ”¸ 10. Centralized Authentication (Advanced)

* [ ] Understand basics of LDAP/Active Directory integration
* [ ] Use `sssd`, `nsswitch.conf`, and PAM for auth configs
* [ ] Authenticate users via Kerberos (concept level)
* [ ] Centralize user home directories using NFS/automount

---

### ðŸ”¸ 11. Security & Best Practices

* [ ] Regularly audit `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow` for anomalies
* [ ] Check for unused or inactive accounts
* [ ] Use tools like `faillock` or `pam_tally2` to monitor failed logins
* [ ] Enforce least privilege using groups and sudo

---

### âœ… Bonus: Practice Tasks

* [ ] Create 5 users and assign different groups and shells
* [ ] Configure a user with a locked account and password expiration
* [ ] Set up a shared directory using SGID
* [ ] Use `sudo` to allow a user to run only specific commands
* [ ] Script bulk creation of users from a CSV file

  <summary>DNS</summary>
Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of DNS administration topics specifically within the context of Linux system administration. These cover both foundational concepts and hands-on administration skills:

---

## ðŸ“˜ DNS Administration Topics in Linux

### 1. **Introduction to DNS**

* What is DNS?
* DNS hierarchy: Root, TLD, authoritative servers
* DNS record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, NS, PTR, SRV, SOA
* Recursive vs iterative queries

---

### 2. **Linux DNS Client Configuration**

* `/etc/resolv.conf`
* `nmcli` or NetworkManager for DNS configuration
* Setting up DNS in `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`
* Testing DNS resolution using:

  * `dig`
  * `nslookup`
  * `host`

---

### 3. **BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) â€“ DNS Server**

* Installing BIND: `bind9` or `named`
* BIND configuration files:

  * `/etc/named.conf` or `/etc/bind/named.conf`
  * `/var/named/` or `/etc/bind/zones/`
* Creating and editing zone files
* Forward and reverse DNS zones
* Zone file syntax and TTLs

---

* Flushing DNS cache (on client and server)
* Tools for testing: `dig +trace`, `drill`

---

### 8. **DNS Security**

* DNSSEC basics and configuration

* Using `named-checkconf` and `named-checkzone` for validation

---

### 9. **Logging and Troubleshooting**

* Enabling query logging
* Debugging with `dig`, `tcpdump`, `journalctl`

* Scripting DNS updates with `nsupdate`
* Managing DNS with Ansible/Bash scripts
* Zone file templating

---

### 11. **High Availability and Redundancy**

* Zone transfers (AXFR, IXFR)
* Load balancing DNS servers

---

### 12. **DNS Forwarding and Conditional Forwarding**

* Setting up forwarders in BIND
* Split-horizon DNS (internal vs external views)
* Using `views` in BIND for conditional DNS serving

---

### 13. **Local DNS Servers for Development**
